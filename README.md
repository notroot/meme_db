# Meme DB
Communication takes images, specifically stupid images from the internet. 

Linking these images into conversation windows poses too problems

1. Finding them on the internet sometimes requires rolling the dice on accidently finding "other" images
2. If the name is in the URL it takes all the fun away from the repient having to open it to understand what you could have just said with words

## Enter Meme DB!
Meme DB is a horribly written app in Flask for hosting your own repository of images. Then you can generate an obfuscated URL to any image
and share it with your friends. 

It was originally even more horribly [written in Perl](https://gist.github.com/notroot/731dcc4b82f84f708f4e) but I am now porting it over to 
Python with Flask cause that's what I know

### Why do I need this?
You don't, you should probably move on

### How do I deploy this?
Good luck, its kind of undocumented right now, it needs a sqlite databse, which, I don't include the schema for, 
so I should do that. If you know Flask you could probably get it running

### I have feedback
OK, thanks. You can leave it right over there .....
